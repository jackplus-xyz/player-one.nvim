## Demo

## Overview

`player-one.nvim` brings audio feedback to your editing experience by playing retro-style sound effects on Neovim events. Built with sfxr sound synthesis, it generates 8-bit sounds without on the fly without any audio files.

## Features

- Built-in sound themes
- Event-based sound triggers
- Performance focused
- Extensive customization

## Requirements

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) >= 0.9.0

### System Support Status

| Operating System | Status | Notes                        |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| macOS            | ✅     | Tested on macOS Sequoia 15.2 |
| Linux            | ⚠️     | Not tested                   |
| Windows          | ⚠️     | Not tested                   |

## Quickstart

1. Install with your favorite package manager:

2. Restart NeoVim and you should now hear:

   - A startup melody when Neovim launches
   - Typing sounds in insert mode
   - Save confirmation sounds
   - And more!

## Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "jackplus-xyz/player-one.nvim",
  ---@type PlayerOne.Config
  opts = {
    -- your configuration comes here
    -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
    -- refer to the configuration section below
  }
}
```

## Configuration

`player-one.nvim` comes with the following default configuration:

```lua
---@class PlayerOne.Config
{
  ---@type boolean Whether the sound theme is enabled
  is_enabled = true,

  ---@type number Minimum interval between sounds in seconds
  min_interval = 0.05,

  ---@type PlayerOne.Theme|string Either a preset name or custom sounds table
  theme = "chiptune",
}
```

### Theme

A Theme is a collection of sounds. Just like how colorschemes map colors to text objects, themes map sound effects to Neovim events.

The plugin comes with three built-in themes:

- `chiptune`: Classic 8-bit game sounds (default)
- `crystal`: Clear, crystalline sounds with sparkling tones
- `synth`: Modern synthesizer sounds with smooth tones

When an event occurs (like saving a file or moving the cursor), the theme plays its corresponding sound effect.

And of course, you can create your own theme to customize exactly how your editor sounds. See [Theme Configuration](wiki/Theme)
